//Searching algorithm

// 1. Use __proto__ to assign prototypes in a way that any property lookup will follow the path: pockets → bed → table → head. For instance, pockets.pen should be 3 (found in table), and bed.glasses should be 1 (found in head).
// 2. Answer the question: is it faster to get glasses as pockets.glasses or head.glasses? Benchmark if needed.

let head = {
    glasses: 1
};

let table = {
    pen: 3
};

let bed = {
    sheet: 1,
    pillow: 2
};

let pockets = {
    money: 2000
};

// Solution starts here

//Pocket inherits bed
//Bed inherits table
//Table inherits head

pockets.__proto__ = bed;
bed.__proto__ = table;
table.__proto__ = head;
